Collection of generic data structures in Go ðŸ“¦

* Free software: MIT License

## Project Description

Small, useful, zero dependency implementations of generic collection data structures in Go:

* Hash sets
* Stacks
* Queues

I wrote these primarily for use in some of my other projects but they are useful enough to be applicable in most scenarios (thanks to Go 1.18 and generics!).

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/collections
```

## Quickstart

### Set

A set is an unordered collection of unique items offering fast lookup and membership checking.

```go
// Initialise a new set with a concrete type
s := set.New[string]()

// Add items to the set
s.Add("hello")
s.Add("sets")
s.Add("in")
s.Add("go")

// All the methods you'd expect
s.Contains("hello") // true
s.Length() // 4

// Remove an item,
s.Remove("go")
s.Length() // 3

// Rich comparison with other sets
other := set.New[string]()
other.Add("hello")
other.Add("more")

// Union: combine both sets into one
set.Union(s, other) // ["hello", "in", "sets", "more"]

// Intersection: all items present in both sets
set.Intersection(s, other) // ["hello"]

// Difference: items in s but not in other
set.Difference(s, other) // ["sets", "in"]
```
