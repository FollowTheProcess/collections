# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to collections, it is open source under the [MIT License] and welcomes contributions of all kinds!

## Feature Requests, Bugs or Questions

Please file an issue on GitHub and choose the appropriate issue template. If your issue doesn't fall into any category feel free to file a blank issue!

## Pull Requests

* It is recommended to file an issue before starting to work on anything (unless it's a very small tweak), this gives you chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
* All code changes must have an accompanying test
* Update the tests or documentation if appropriate

## Developing

collections uses [just] for project automation (testing, linting etc.) so feel free to install it if you want to use the defined tasks, otherwise everything is done with standard go commands (go test, go fmt etc.)

Everything will be run in CI on your PR but it is recommended to test as much as possible locally before pushing üëçüèª
